This error is unresolved due to unexpected problems, the probability of its successful functioning is quite random. The expected problem according to the developers can be located at the button for "save later" and "add to cart" in cart.php 

You need click "previous" and reload cart.php after clicking "save for later" and "add to cart" in cart.php. 

The webpage, however, works correctly if the user presses the reload button on some occasions (e.g. when multiple entries in cart item are registered, same issues are encountered). 

recommendations suggested is the arrangement of technical errors.
Any ideas for resolving this problem would be helpful for furthermore improvements.
